Created in 2012 as part of a research project exploring how conductive inks could impact on the music industry.

Pressing the conductive ink buttons on the cards played audio content. I created three versions of the postcard player, the first exploratory prototype was made from laser cut acrylic and allowed experimentation of lots of different types of audio content. The second was created from laser cut plywood and connected to Soundcloud and Spotify to play online playlists. The third version, which was exhibited at the Design Museum in London was made from laser cut, folded powder coated steel with an internal acrylic structure.
