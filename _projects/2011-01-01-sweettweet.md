Sweet Tweet is a connected object that notifies you each time you get a new twitter follower. It was created for the Uniform studio when we were experimenting with social media for brands. We were interested in ideas that connected the whole studio to our social accounts rather than a few dedicated individuals.  The visual design was based on a mechanised cuckoo clock from a studio animation that we had created. Each time a new twitter account followed Uniform, the dial on the clock spun, it made a train whistle noise, and a wooden train pushed a gumball onto a paper rollercoaster.
