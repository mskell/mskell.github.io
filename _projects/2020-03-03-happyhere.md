HappyHere was a participatory, immersive light installation, created for Pig Rock Bothy, which used colour and light to visualise thoughts and feelings. The technology turned visitorâ€™s answers to seven simple questions into a narrative of light and colour, featured on a custom-built screen in the installation. After dark, Pig Rock Bothy became a beacon of coloured light, replaying all of the feelings recorded by it during the day and transmitting it out into the night sky.

This installation was created in collaboration with Pete Thomas and was commissioned by National Galleries of Scotland for Pig Rock Bothy.
