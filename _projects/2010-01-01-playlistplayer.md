A student project completed in 2010. Playlist Player was a concept product for listening to digital music files. As digital music collections grow and the listening possibilities become infinite, how can we retain meaning and connection with our ever-expanding music libraries. This mash-up between mix tapes, vinyl records and digital playlists allows you to sync a digital playlist to a physical object, and create your own artwork to represent the collection of tracks. Placing the playlist disc onto the player would begin playback, and the illuminated light rings show you time progress through the complete list, not the exact minute count. You can’t skip forward or backward through the tracks, but you can pause playback by lifting up the disc and resume by replacing it. A throwback to an era where music tracks were celebrated and enjoyed, not skipped through one after the other.
