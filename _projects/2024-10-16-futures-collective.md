The Futures Collective was a three month research project in collaboration with Dundee Central Library exploring co-design methods for encouraging innovative healthcare ideas for 25 years in the future.

We were interested in the future of care and medicine and how speculative design can enable people to imagine health and care inventions for 25 years in the future. This project focused on imagining and prototyping – or modelling – artefacts of the future in a series of creative workshops with young people. Giving focus to imaginative artefacts of the future allowed participants the opportunity to visualise, share, and interact with objects that embody or relate to healthcare issues. A pop up kiosk was installed in a central library encouraging people working in the space to get involved and submit an innovative idea to the project by drawing it up on a worksheet and posting it in the kiosk. An exhibition was also delivered in the library to celebrate the young peoples wonderful responses in the creative workshops. 

This project was published as it emerged on a website that enabled us to promote the workshops, the kiosk and the exhibition [Futures Collective](https://sites.dundee.ac.uk/futurescollective/)
