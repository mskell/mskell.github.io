In the summer of 2024 I was invited to attend a Creative Technology workshop hosted by the HiCraft Research project team at Northumbria School of Design. This three day event provided an opportunity to build and discuss exploratory prototypes with craft makers and creative technologists. This work will be developed through 2024 & 2025.
