## Hello!

I’m a [design researcher](https://www.dundee.ac.uk/people/martin-skelly) and lecturer in [Product Design](https://www.dundee.ac.uk/undergraduate/product-design) at the [University of Dundee](https://www.dundee.ac.uk/djcad/).

Please get in touch if you would like to discuss a research collaboration at martin.skelly.contact @ gmail . com (without the spaces) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinskelly/).

### Biography

Martin lectures in Product Design and Creative Technologies at the University of Dundee, leading modules on the role of prototyping, the design of physical digital objects, physical computing and internet connected objects. His research focuses on creating speculative, robust, crafted research products that explore alternative futures for emerging technologies at the intersection of design, creative technologies and human computer interaction (HCI). His research has been exhibited internationally in Almhult, Amsterdam, Bangalore, Berlin, Brussels, Dundee, Edinburgh, London, Mexico City, Oslo, San Francisco and Vienna.

Before joining academia, Martin worked for a design week top 100 design agency in Business Development, Product Design and Creative Technology roles. His work in industry was featured widely in the media and has been exhibited in the Design Museum, Natural History Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum. Selected clients include the BBC, NHS, Coca-Cola, Liverpool Football Club and the Met Office.

Martin’s research and teaching explores questions around privacy, security, user agency and ethics in our increasingly automated, algorithmically monitored lives. He creates data driven products and designs meaningful experiences that link our physical world with our digital world.
